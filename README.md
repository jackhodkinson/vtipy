Welcome to vtipy! The Variable Temperature Impedance PYthon library designed to allow a Raspberry Pi automate a Solartron 1260 impedance analyser, Eurotherm Temperature controller, and external thermocouple. This library was designed as part of my PhD thesis.

Documentation on the library can be found in the Docs directory. More documentation about its installation is coming soon. Please get in touch if you have any questions in the meantime.
